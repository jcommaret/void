Void is the open-source Cursor alternative.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. Void sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for Void. If you're new, welcome!

## Note

We've paused work on the Void IDE (this repo) to explore a few novel coding ideas. We want to focus on innovation over feature-parity. Void will continue running, but without maintenance some existing features might stop working over time. Depending on the direction of our new work, we might not resume Void as an IDE.

We won't be actively reviewing Issues and PRs, but we will respond to all [email](mailto:hello@voideditor.com) inquiries on building and maintaining your own version of Void while we're paused. 

## Reference

Void is a fork of the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository. For a guide to the codebase, see [VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/main/VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md).

For a guide on how to develop your own version of Void, see [HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/main/HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md) and [void-builder](https://github.com/voideditor/void-builder).
