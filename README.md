## Note

This is my fork of Void, to maintain my own version of Void, and keep updating the models and try to improve capabilities.

## Reference

Void is a fork of the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository. For a guide to the codebase, see [VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/main/VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md).

For a guide on how to develop your own version of Void, see [HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/main/HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md) and [void-builder](https://github.com/voideditor/void-builder).
